dinamic transform origin  
<!-- clamp scale decrease   -->
doesn't work on touch, only mouse  
restrain slightly dragging on X axis
when dragging keep the window always on top  
make a sign when back() is triggered or lock scroll  

# questions  -->
what is the right way to keep track of primitives. ref.current is does not notify. useMemo, useState?
